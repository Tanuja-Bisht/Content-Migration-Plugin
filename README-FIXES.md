# WordPress Content Migrator - Fixes

This document explains the fixes applied to the WordPress Content Migrator plugin to address issues with content duplication and incorrect migration counts.

## Fix: Content Duplication & Incorrect Migration Counts

### Problem
The plugin was showing incorrect migration count summaries:
- Items marked as "created/updated" included both new and existing content
- This could be misleading as existing content was being recounted in the success total
- The skipped count was too low, as it wasn't properly counting existing content

### Solution
We've made the following changes:

1. **Modified content handling for existing posts/pages**
   - The plugin now always skips existing content (both posts and pages)
   - Even when "Allow overwrite" is checked, existing content will be skipped to prevent duplicates
   - This ensures no existing content is modified

2. **Fixed status reporting**
   - Content that already exists is now correctly marked with "skipped" status
   - Only truly new content is counted as "success"
   - This gives an accurate count of what has been created vs. what was skipped

3. **Updated explanatory messages**
   - Clarified the explanation of migration counts
   - Removed references to "allow_overwrite" in messages
   - Added more detailed explanations in the admin UI

4. **Added test case**
   - Created a test file (`test-fix-result.php`) to verify the fixes work correctly
   - Tests both new and existing content handling

## To Verify the Fix

1. Run the migration process with a mix of new and existing content
2. Check that the migration results show the correct count:
   - Created/updated: Only truly new content
   - Skipped: Any content that already exists
   - Failed: Content that couldn't be processed due to errors

3. Alternatively, run the test file directly:
   ```
   wp-content/plugins/wordpress-content-migrator/test-fix-result.php
   ```

## Additional Notes

- These changes prioritize data safety by ensuring existing content is never modified
- The migration process is now more predictable and safer to run multiple times
- If you need to update existing content, you'll need to do it manually
